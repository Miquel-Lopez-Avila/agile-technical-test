## Getting started

```
  git clone

  cd agile-technical-test

  npm i

  npm run dev
```

## Layout

```bash
.
└── agile-technical-test/
    ├── public
    └── src/
        ├── application/
        ├── common/
        ├── pages/
        ├── Application.tsx
        └── main.tsx
```

`common`: Where all the common components are located.

`application`: Where all structural components of the application are located.

`pages`: Where all the pages of the application are located.

## Code quality

It is made with

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to ensure code quality and consistency.

## Styles

I've used **styled-components** to create a consistent and reusable style system for the project. It allows us to define reusable components and styles that can be easily applied to different parts of the application.

## Testing

Finally, I've used **Cypress and Vitest**. These tests ensure that the application functions as expected and that it meets the requirements.
